# Stripe Payment Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a complete Stripe payment integration for your freelance services. Here's what's been added:

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Flow
- **Service Selection**: Each service card now has a "Get Started" button that navigates to a secure payment page
- **Customer Information**: Comprehensive form to collect customer details
- **Secure Payment**: Stripe Elements for secure card processing
- **Payment Success**: Confirmation page with order details and next steps

### 2. Pages Created
- **Payment Page** (`/payment`): Complete checkout experience with Stripe integration
- **Payment Success** (`/payment-success`): Order confirmation and next steps

### 3. Backend Integration
- **Payment Intent API**: Server endpoint to create Stripe payment intents
- **Webhook Support**: Handle Stripe events for payment confirmations
- **Customer Creation**: Automatically create Stripe customers

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Stripe Account
1. Go to [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Complete your account setup

### Step 2: Get Your Stripe Keys
1. Go to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Navigate to **Developers > API Keys**
3. Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
4. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
# Copy from .env.example
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your Stripe keys:
```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration
1. Start your development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the Freelance page
3. Click "Get Started" on any service
4. Fill in the customer information
5. Use Stripe's test card numbers:
   - **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - **CVV**: Any 3 digits
   - **Expiry**: Any future date

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
